For this project I changed all of the div tags in the html document to semantic text. I also cleaned up the page by spacing and organizing the code.
All of the images on the page were given an Alt name and the website was given a title. The "SEO" in the main title was made darker and more noticable
as it stands for something important on the website. This was then all uploaded to my github repository for others to view.
